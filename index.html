              My name is Anisiobi Kosisochukwu Cynthia. I graduated from Nnamdi
              Azikiwe University (Unizik), Awka, Nigeria, with a second class
              upper division honors in Computer Science in 2023. During my
              studies, I served as the Executive President of the Nigeria
              Association of Computing Students (NACOS), Unizik chapter, where I
              developed strong leadership and organizational skills. My
              professional experience includes several key roles. I worked as a
              Project Manager at PeachBlossoms Ltd., where I coordinated teams
              of designers, developers, and stakeholders. I managed risk
              assessments and used tools like Trello to keep projects on track
              and within budget.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I also served as the Deputy Managing Director at Sambros
              Enterprise from March 2022 to December 2022. In this role, I
              assisted with strategic decision-making and oversaw daily
              operations to ensure efficiency. Building and maintaining strong
              client and partner relationships was a crucial part of my job. In
              the summer of 2022, I was a Virtual Assistant Team Lead for
              Tech4dev’s Women in Tech program. I managed daily operations,
              assigned tasks, and set priorities, which helped me enhance my
              organizational and leadership skills. From April 2021 to November
              2021, I worked as a Social Media Manager at Genesys Tech Hub. My
              responsibilities included developing and executing social media
              strategies, managing the company’s presence on platforms like
              Instagram and Twitter, and engaging with our online community.

            <p>
              Currently, I am involved in the HNG internship as a Product
              Manager for Team Bingo and also serve as the Assistant Sub-Team
              Lead of the Documentation and Research team. I’ve been responsible
              for researching and creating detailed tickets outlining tasks and
              features needed for our project. I also wrote a Product
              Requirements Document (PRD) for Remote Bingo, detailing user
              stories, feature descriptions, and technical specifications. This
              document played a key role in guiding our project and was
              submitted as part of our project documentation. My diverse
              experience has equipped me with skills in digital marketing,
              social media management, project management, and product
              management, which have been valuable in my contributions to the
              HNG internship and my professional growth.
